# AWS DDNS Agent

This is a project in the works for creating an agent that is installed on your server to update the DNS A record automatically with it's public IP address. That way, if your server does not have a static IP address, the DNS record will automatically be updated when the IP address changes. This particular bot is designed to work with the AWS Route 53 domain registrar.
